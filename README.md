https://enterherokulink.com

---
## Requirements:
1. Ability to create notes and code snippets with or without internet access.
2. Open the text editor by running 'npm run start' from the root directoy.
3. This will startup the backend and serve the client.
4. On startup, the javascript files are bundled using webpack and IndexedDB creates a database storage.
5. Also generated are an HTML file, service worker and manifest file.
6. The use of babel allows the use of ES6 with older version without errors.
7. Everything saves in the text editor even if it is closed, thanks to IndexedDB.
8. Clicking on the install button will download the web application (PWA).
9. Loading the web application will have a registered service worker using workbox and it will have static addest precached.
10. Deployed to Heroku with proper build scripts for a webpack application.

## Process:
Started with some inital code to build on top of. Significantly easier than the last assignment. A lot of the code snippets that I added in were fresh in my memory from the previous weeks lessons. I knew where to look and what I was looking for, and then adding to this application and making it work seemed like a very natural flow.
